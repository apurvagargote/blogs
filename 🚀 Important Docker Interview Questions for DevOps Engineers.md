1. **🐳 What is the difference between the Docker command COPY vs. ADD?**
    
    * **COPY** simply copies files or directories from your host into the image.
        
    * **ADD** offers additional functionality—it can extract compressed files (like tar archives) and even fetch files from remote URLs.
        
2. **🔧 What is the difference between the Docker command CMD vs. RUN?**
    
    * **CMD** sets the default command that executes when the container starts, but it can be overridden at runtime.
        
    * **RUN** executes commands during the image build process, such as installing packages or setting up configurations.
        
3. **📉 How will you reduce the size of a Docker image?**
    
    * Use multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from the final image.
        
    * Choose minimal base images (like Alpine Linux).
        
    * Remove unnecessary files, clean up caches, and consolidate commands to minimize layers.
        
4. **❓ Why and when should you use Docker?**
    
    * **Why:** Docker ensures consistent, isolated environments, making deployments predictable across development, testing, and production.
        
    * **When:** Use Docker when building microservices, automating CI/CD pipelines, or when you need rapid, scalable application deployments.
        
5. **🔗 Explain the Docker components and how they interact with each other.**
    
    * **Docker Engine:** The runtime responsible for building and running containers.
        
    * **Docker Images:** Immutable snapshots that serve as blueprints for containers.
        
    * **Docker Containers:** Running instances of Docker images that encapsulate an application’s environment.
        
    * **Docker Registries:** Platforms (like Docker Hub) that store and distribute images.
        
6. **📝 Explain the terminology: Docker Compose, Dockerfile, Docker Image, Docker Container.**
    
    * **Docker Compose:** A tool that uses a YAML file to define and manage multi-container applications.
        
    * **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.
        
    * **Docker Image:** A packaged snapshot of your application and its dependencies.
        
    * **Docker Container:** A runtime instance of an image that is isolated from the host system.
        
7. **💼 In what real scenarios have you used Docker?**
    
    * Deploying microservices architectures in production environments.
        
    * Creating consistent local development environments that mirror production systems.
        
    * Automating build, test, and deployment processes in CI/CD pipelines.
        
8. **⚖️ Docker vs. Hypervisor?**
    
    * **Docker:** Uses OS-level virtualization where containers share the host’s kernel, making them lightweight and fast.
        
    * **Hypervisors:** Provide full virtualization by running separate OS instances, which generally use more resources.
        
9. **👍 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Docker?**
    
    * **Advantages:**  
        • Portability and consistency across environments  
        • Efficient resource usage and quick deployment  
        • Simplified dependency management
        
    * **Disadvantages:**  
        • Potential security concerns due to shared kernel  
        • Complexities in networking and orchestration  
        • Persistent storage challenges
        
10. **🔍 What is a Docker namespace?**
    
    * Docker namespaces provide isolated environments for system resources (like process IDs, networking, and file systems), ensuring that containers remain separated from each other and the host.
        
11. **🏛️ What is a Docker registry?**
    
    * A Docker registry is a system for storing and distributing Docker images. Public registries (such as Docker Hub) allow open sharing, while private registries are used for proprietary images.
        
12. **🚪 What is an entry point?**
    
    * The entry point, defined in a Dockerfile with the ENTRYPOINT instruction, specifies the default executable that runs when the container starts, effectively setting the main process for the container.
        
13. **🔄 How do you implement CI/CD in Docker?**
    
    * Integrate Docker with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deploying Docker images. This ensures consistent deployments and rapid feedback cycles.
        
14. **💾 Will data on the container be lost when the Docker container exits?**
    
    * Yes, by default, data stored within a container is lost upon its exit. To persist data, Docker volumes or bind mounts should be used.
        
15. **🛡️ What is a Docker swarm?**
    
    * Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration solution, enabling you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system for easier scaling and management.
        
16. **🛠️ What are some common Docker commands?**
    
    * **Viewing running containers:** `docker ps`
        
    * **Running a container under a specific name:** `docker run --name <name> ...`
        
    * **Exporting a Docker image:** `docker save -o image.tar <image_name>`
        
    * **Importing an image:** `docker load -i image.tar`
        
    * **Deleting a container:** `docker rm <container_id>`
        
    * **Removing unused resources:** `docker system prune -a`
        
17. **📏 What are common practices to reduce Docker image size?**
    
    * Use multi-stage builds to eliminate unnecessary build artifacts.
        
    * Choose minimal and optimized base images.
        
    * Remove temporary files and clean up caches after installations.
        
18. **🔧 How do you troubleshoot a Docker container that is not starting?**
    
    * Inspect logs with `docker logs <container_id>`.
        
    * Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to check configuration details.
        
    * Test container behavior in interactive mode to diagnose issues.
        
19. **🌐 Can you explain the Docker networking model?**
    
    * Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and the host. Common models include:  
        • **Bridge networks:** Default network for container communication.  
        • **Host networks:** Containers share the host's networking stack.  
        • **Overlay networks:** Used for multi-host communication, especially in swarm mode.
        
20. **💾 How do you manage persistent storage in Docker?**
    
    * Use Docker volumes or bind mounts to store data outside the container’s filesystem, ensuring data persists even if the container is removed.
        
21. **🔒 How do you secure a Docker container?**
    
    * Limit container privileges and capabilities.
        
    * Use trusted, regularly scanned images.
        
    * Implement network segmentation and secure data with Docker secrets.
        
    * Keep both the container and host systems updated with security patches.
        
22. **🔗 What is Docker overlay networking?**
    
    * Overlay networking enables secure communication between containers across different Docker hosts, which is especially useful in Docker Swarm for connecting services on multiple nodes.
        
23. **🌍 How do you handle environment variables in Docker?**
    
    * Environment variables can be passed using the `-e` flag with `docker run` or defined in a Docker Compose file. This allows you to configure application settings without hardcoding them.
