Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks and manage systems efficiently. This challenge covers essential Bash scripting concepts like comments, variables, built-in variables, and wildcards.

---

## 📌 **Understanding the Challenge**

Here’s what we’ll cover in our script:

✅ **Comments (**`#`) – Add explanatory notes in the script.  
✅ **Echo (**`echo`) – Display messages in the terminal.  
✅ **Variables (**`var=value`) – Store and manage data.  
✅ **Using Variables (**`$((expression))`) – Perform operations using stored values.  
✅ **Built-in Variables (**`$USER, $HOME, $PWD, $SHELL, $HOSTNAME, $OSTYPE`) – Access system information.  
✅ **Wildcards (**`*.txt, ?file.*, [abc]*.sh`) – List files with a specific pattern.

## 📝 **The Complete Shell Script**

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

# ====Task 1: Comments ====
# This script demonstrates various shell scripting concepts.

# ====Task 2: Echo ====
echo "Welcome to the Shell Scripting Challenge!"

# ====Task 3: Variables ====
name="Bash Scripting"
age=10

# Displaying variable values
echo "Topic: $name"
echo "Years of Experience: $age"

# ====Task 4: Using Variables (Simple Addition) ====
num1=10
num2=20
sum=$((num1 + num2))

echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"

# ====Task 5: Using Built-in Variables ====
echo "Current User: $USER"
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
echo "Current Working Directory: $PWD"
echo "Current Shell: $SHELL"
echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
echo "Operating System Type: $OSTYPE"
echo "Current Date and Time: $(date)"
echo "System Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "Current Logged-in Users: $(who)"

# ====Task 6: Wildcards (Listing files based on patterns)====
echo "Listing all .txt files in the current directory:"
ls *.txt  # Lists all text files

echo "Listing all .sh files that start with 'script':"
ls script*.sh  # Lists all shell scripts starting with "script"

echo "Listing all files that start with any letter a, b, or c and end with .sh:"
ls [abc]*.sh  # Lists all shell scripts starting with a, b, or c

echo "Listing all files with any single character before 'file' and any extension:"
ls ?file.*  # Lists files like 'afile.txt', 'bfile.csv'
```

## 🔍 **Breaking Down the Script**

📌 **Shebang (**`#!/bin/bash`) – Defines the script interpreter.  
📌 **Comments (**`#`) – Used to add explanations.  
📌 **Echo (**`echo "text"`) – Prints messages to the terminal.  
📌 **Variables (**`var=value`) – Stores data.  
📌 **Arithmetic Operations (**`$((expression))`) – Performs calculations.  
📌 **Built-in Variables (**`$USER, $HOME, $PWD, $SHELL, $HOSTNAME, $OSTYPE`) – Displays system info.  
📌 **Wildcards (**`*.txt, script*.sh, [abc]*.sh, ?file.*`) – Lists specific files.
